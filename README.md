#summit-view

##Summit
A summit is a point on a surface that is higher in elevation than all points immediately adjacent to it. Mathematically, a summit is a local maximum in elevation.

##Usage
`npm install summit-view`

More docs coming. In the meantime take a look at [the example app](https://github.com/summit-view/summit-view-app-example).

##Current goals of the project

- [x] Support for moving and resizing panels, snap-to-grid.
- [ ] Provide a settings API for panels.
- [ ] Themeable.
- [ ] Configurable.

##Inspiration
Summit view was inspired by the [Status Board by Panic Inc](https://panic.com/statusboard/) and the ongoing [Panic Board project at 24HR Malm√∂](https://www.24hr.se/projekt/strukturerad-information-via-storskarm/).

The idea is to deliver contextually relevant real-time data. Perfect for example in an office environment.
